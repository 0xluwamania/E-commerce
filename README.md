# E-commerce
This is an E commerce website with the backend designed with Flask (Python), the database uses the SQLite3and the front end was designed with HTML, CSS BootStrap and Java Script. The programming concept of Model View Controller (MVC) was adopted during the development of this app. It hasnt been hosted yet however every functionality has been executed and its ready for deployment. The Project was developed as the final Project from the Harvard CS50 course which introduced me to the C programing Language, Python, SQLite3 alongside HTML, CSS, JS and Flask. 
The project has several database for the vendors and the users.
the vendors can display their products and the homepage of the website is automatically updated with new products. The merchant can always login to his dashboard to assess orders pending. 
Users can also create accounts and make purchases of different products updated by merchants.
The project wasnt executed alone.
